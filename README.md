## Experimental Design and Parameters

This pilot study is grounded in the **'30-item instrument'** (Main Text, p.2) developed by **Ruggeri et al. (2022)**. 

While the original study employed an **adaptive procedure** (p.2)—selectively presenting items contingent on participant choices for efficiency—this pilot adopts a **fixed-list approach**, sequentially presenting **'all possible values'** as specified in **Supplementary Table 1** (Supple, p.21). 

This full-enumeration method is intended to:
1. Eliminate data blind spots that may arise from adaptive algorithms during the pilot phase.
2. Verify participant response consistency across the entire range of values.

### 1. Specific Values for Choice Tasks

The monetary values used in this pilot study are derived from the *"Possible values for delayed options"* specified in **Supplementary Table 1 (p. 21)** of Ruggeri et al. (2022). While the original study utilized an adaptive procedure, this pilot presents all possible values to ensure comprehensive data collection.

The specific amounts were calculated based on the percentage increases used in the original study, adjusted for the **South Korean context** (Base amount: **500,000 KRW**, approximately 10% of monthly household income).

| Percentage | Original Value (USD) | Applied Value (KRW) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **101%** | $505 | **505,000 KRW** |
| **102%** | $510 | **510,000 KRW** |
| **110%** | $550 | **550,000 KRW** |
| **120%** | $600 | **600,000 KRW** |
| **150%** | $750 | **750,000 KRW** |

**Implementation Note:**
* **Small Gain / Loss / Present Bias / Speedup / Subadditivity:** The five values listed above (505,000 ~ 750,000 KRW) are used as the standard set for these conditions.
* **Large Gain:** Values are scaled by a factor of 10 (**5,050,000 ~ 7,500,000 KRW**) to test for the magnitude effect.

### 2. Survey Instruments

The demographic and financial survey consists of 10 items, strictly adhering to the variable definitions provided in the **Methods** section and **Supplementary Information (p. 4)** of Ruggeri et al. (2022).

| Variable | Source Location | Definition / Scale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Q1. Age** | Supple p. 4 | Integer input between 18 and 100. |
| **Q2. Gender** | Supple p. 4 | Three options: Male, Female, Other. |
| **Q3. Education** | Supple p. 4 | Five categories ranging from "Primary education or less" to "Higher or Graduated degree". |
| **Q4. Employment** | Supple p. 4 | Seven categories including Full-time, Part-time, Student, Retired, etc. |
| **Q5. Income** | Supple p. 4 | Self-reported individual pre-tax annual income. |
| **Q6. Debt** | Supple p. 4 | Self-reported individual total debt (excluding mortgages). |
| **Q7. Assets** | Supple p. 4 | Self-reported individual total assets (including savings and property). |
| **Q8. Risk Preference** | Main Text p. 2 | Simplified risk preference measured on a 0–10 scale. |
| **Q9. Economic Outlook** | Main Text p. 2 | Outlook on the national economy (Better, Same, Worse). |
| **Q10. Financial Outlook** | Main Text p. 2 | Outlook on personal financial circumstances (Better, Same, Worse). |
